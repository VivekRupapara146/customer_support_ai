"""
Router v1: rule/keyword-based. Multi-agent match is expected and allowed
(e.g. "paid yesterday but Premium still locked" -> billing + technical).
Zero matches route to FAQ as a safe default (never silently drops a query).

matched_keywords is logged so we have real data before comparing this
against v2 (LLM-based) and v2b (trained classifier) later.
